# Odin Project - Cyberattacks in a nutshell

## Pass the Hash

Abusing the challenge-and-response nature of NTLM to authenticate as a user with only the NTLM hash of the userâ€™s password.

1) Steal password hashes (most common way to do that is extracting hashes from lsass.exe but you need to have administrative privileges on the computer)
2) Use the pass-the-hash technique to authenticate as the compromised user (by using ```mimikatz sekurlsa::pth``` for example)
